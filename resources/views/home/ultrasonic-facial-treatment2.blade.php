<h1 class="margin-bottom-15">Benefits of a Ultrasonic Facial</h1>

<p>Professional Estheticians perform ultrasonic facials to thoroughly cleanse the skin. Many doctors highly recommend this treatment because it can be used on people who have sensitive skin, thin skin, blackheads, and whiteheads. People with Rosacea and especially acne can benefit from this treatment because it deeply cleanses the skin.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>An Esthetician attaches a small rectangular metal plate to a hand device that moves 28,000 vibrations per second while sliding across the skin. It is not an unpleasant feeling and the device is grounded so you cannot get shocked from it.
In the process of cleansing your skin, the ultrasonic facial removes the top layer of the dead skin cells that tend to dull the skin. The more you resurface the outer layer of skin, the more skin growth will come up from underneath and be renewed. Your pores will appear smaller and tighter with an all over healthy glow.</p>
<p>Most importantly, another benefit of Ultrasonic facial is to help penetrate product into the skin. There is a big difference when purchasing products. There are those that float on the top layer of your skin and others that absorb into the skin. Always look for products that say, Chirally Correct, deep penetration or quick absorbent, and especially those that use the word Serum. Serums are extremely vital and are considered to be food for the skin as moisturizers are considered to be the water for the skin. After completely covering the face with serums or moisturizers, the machine is used on a low frequency setting while the waves help penetrate deeper than it would on its own. For acne prone skin, treatment medicated creams are used. Once it gets deeper into the skin the more results you see because the product actually gets down into the cellular level and can really work.</p>
