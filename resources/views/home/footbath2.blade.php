<p>In today’s toxic environment, chemical and heavy metal residues and cellular tissue acid wastes are held up in the body faster than ever before resulting in a greater incidence of allergies as well as mental and physical incapacitation. Everyday living in today’s polluted and stressful environment with chemicals such as pesticides, additives, and preservatives found in much of our food, water, and beauty products can burden our body. The body’s excretion pathways may be able to counteract these negative influences for a time, but they can become overwhelmed after long-term exposure. This buildup of toxins throughout the body compromises our health and appearance. Many healing traditions except Western medicine offer body purification as a means of healing and avoiding disease. Pimples; rashes; dark circles under the eyes; swollen joints; yellow, green and blotches complexions often indicate a buildup of tissue acid wastes inside the body. Other symptoms include headaches, tiredness, overweight, constipation, allergies, anxiety, wrinkles, and stress. Modifying your diet along with the Ionic Cleanse Detox Machine sessions can substantially reduce and even eliminate these conditions.</p>
