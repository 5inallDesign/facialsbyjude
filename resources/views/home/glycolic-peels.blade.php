<h1>Glycolic Facial Peels</h1>

<p>The Glycolic Peel is a deep, intensive skin treatment focusing on the resurfacing and renewing of the epidermis.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended by dermatologists for its remarkable skin renewal benefits. Facial chemical peels are a technique used to improve the appearance of the skin. The careful use of glycolic acids will leave your skin as soft and clear as a newborn.</p>

<p>Glycolic acid is derived from sugar cane and, because of its smaller molecular size, effectively works to stimulate growth of new skin and collagen by penetrating the skin and decreasing the bonds that hold dead skin cells on the surface. This allows dead cells to be gradually removed, leaving behind a layer of healthy smooth skin.</p>

<p>Glycolic acid also reduces the amount of surface skin oil, which aids in the removal of blackheads and other skin impurities and may help stimulate collagen production within the dermis, the layers of the skin located below the epidermis.</p>

<p>Glycolic acid treatments minimizes the visible signs of aging, smoothes your complexion, balances irregular skin tone, softens dry skin, and promotes a healthy, youthful glow. Glycolic treatments are also wonderful for acne prone skin.</p>

<p>Today, with the public's increasing interest in rejuvenating the skin and slowing the effects of the aging process, chemical peeling has emerged as an exciting supplement to a total skin care program. A thorough evaluation is imperative before embarking upon a chemical peel.</p>

<h2>Glycolic Acid may also be used to treat the following:</h2>

<p>Acne, Acne Scars, Blackheads/Whiteheads, Dry Skin, Sun-damaged Skin, Blotchy Pigmentation, Fine Wrinkles, Loss of Elasticity, Large Pores, in-grown hairs, Age Spots/Dark Spots.</p>

<h2>Note about Retin A</h2>

<p>If you are using Retin A products and want to try an Acid Peel, you will need to stop the treatments at least two-weeks before using the Peels. Retin A makes the skin very sensitive to the sun and to other products.</p>
