The Ultrasonic Facial Treatment pushes away impurities and dead skin cells.  Ultrasonic waves, in conjunction with special Energized Misting Spray work together to deeply cleanse congested skin pores, clear up acne-prone complexions and prepare the skin for further aesthetic treatments and topical application. The included Misting Spray is made with magnetized and vortexed water which is believed to raise the energy of the ultrasonic vibration to a higher level and utilizes the therapeutic benefits of uplifting Rose Oil.

Improves The Appearance of Aging Skin
The same ultrasonic action is also used to effectively push the active ingredients in your favorite skin care products into your skin. The result is a firmer, brighter, more youthful looking complexion!

Boosts The Performance of Your Existing Skin Care Products
You will notice an overall improvement in the effectiveness of your favorite creams, serums and lotions with treatment! Most skin care products simply sit on top of the skin. The ultrasonic penetrating power of this treatment cleanses away dead skin cells and makes your skin much more receptive to applied topicals, by driving them much deeper below the surface.
