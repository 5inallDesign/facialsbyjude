	<p>I have been going to Jude for her foot baths since I moved here around a year ago.  I was totally skeptic about the treatment helping any of the many foot aliments I am so unfortunate to have.
	Well as it turned out I was overwhelmingly surprised! Judes foot baths have not only worked in reducing my foot pain to where I walk better, but the detoxing benefits have pulled out the toxins in other areas of my body allowing me to experience all over body health!<br>
	Thank you Jude</p>

	<p>Jude's Eyebrow waxing is AMAZING! She takes her time, is detailed, and very precise. She constructs &amp; shapes each brow unique to the individual. I've made the mistake in going elsewhere for an eyebrow waxing and regret the moment I did. Jude uses state of art resources to make every visit a wonderful experience, even when it's just an eyebrow wax. I highly recommend her! Schedule you're next waxing with Jude, you'll be glad you did!</p>

	<p>I hesitated for a long time to have a facial done here...I had been going to a esthetician for over 30 years and was very satisfied. Jude is so much closer so I decided to see her. I was AMAZED at the results and try to schedule monthly appointments. Thank you Jude. You are the greatest!!!!</p>

	<p>I have had facials from Jude Cunningham every two weeks for the past three months. I can see a huge improvement!! The lines on my face have disappeared and so have the dark spots. My face looks smooth and younger. Jude also recommended products I can use at home. I have never been one to spend a lot of time with moisturizers or taking care of my skin but Jude has shown me what the results can be with a few minutes a day. I highly recommend Jude Cunningham. She has a gentle touch with huge results.<br />
	Hope business is booming!</p>
